# AES Encryption and Decryption Script

This Python script (`encrypt_decrypt.py`) demonstrates AES encryption and decryption functionality using the `Crypto.Cipher` module from the `pycryptodome` library. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt files using a password-derived AES key.

## Features

- Encrypts a file (`<file_path>`) using AES encryption with a user-provided password.
- Decrypts an encrypted file (`<file_path>`) using the same password.
- Supports AES encryption in Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.
- Utilizes SHA-256 hashing for password-based key derivation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pycryptodome library (`pip install pycryptodome`)

## Usage

### Encryption

```bash
python encrypt_decrypt.py encrypt <file_path>
```

- Prompts for an encryption password.
- Encrypts the specified file (`<file_path>`) and saves the encrypted data to `"encrypted.enc"` in the same directory.

### Decryption

```bash
python encrypt_decrypt.py decrypt <file_path>
```

- Prompts for a decryption password.
- Decrypts the specified `"encrypted.enc"` file and saves the decrypted data to `"decrypted.png"` in the same directory.

### Notes

- Ensure that Python and the `pycryptodome` library are installed and accessible in your environment.
- The decrypted file will be saved as `"decrypted.png"` regardless of its original format.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Security:** Choose strong passwords for encryption and decryption.
- **Key Management:** Ensure the security of your encryption keys and avoid storing them in plaintext or insecure locations.

## Example

```bash
python encrypt_decrypt.py encrypt my_file.jpg
```

- Encrypts `my_file.jpg` and saves the encrypted data as `encrypted.enc`.

Adjust the `<file_path>` placeholders and example commands as per your script's functionality. Include any additional information relevant to your specific implementation and deployment considerations. This README template provides a structured overview for users to understand, install, and utilize your encryption and decryption script effectively.
